I firmly believe that universities have the responsibility to form close connections to their surrounding communities.
Here is a list of the outreach programs I have been involved with since being at CMU:

* National Biomechanics Day Robot Event: Spring 2023
* 4-Week Robot Program with [Gwen's Girls](https://www.gwensgirls.org): Fall 2023
* 4-Week Virtual CAD Program with Gwen's Girls: Fall 2021 - Fall 2022
