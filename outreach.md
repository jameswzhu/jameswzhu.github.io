I firmly believe that universities have the responsibility to form close connections to their surrounding communities.
Here is a list of the outreach programs I have been involved with since being at CMU:

* National Biomechanics Day Robot Event: Spring 2023
* 4-Week Robot Program with [Gwen's Girls](https://www.gwensgirls.org): Fall 2023
* 4-Week Virtual CAD Program with Gwen's Girls: Fall 2021 - Fall 2022

Additionally, during my internship at The AI Institute, I worked very closely with two partner food pantries in Cambridge: [The Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House](https://margaretfullerhouse.org/service-overview/food-pantry/) and [The East End House](https://eastendhouse.org/get-involved/). Both of these organizations are doing spectacular work in the community and I encourage everyone to get involved with a service community that is meaningful to them.
