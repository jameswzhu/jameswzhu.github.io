I have always loved being a teacher and mentor to younger students. In addition to being a Teaching Assistant for 4 semesters between Vanderbilt and CMU, I have also worked for the
[CMU Eberly Center](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/index.html), particicpating in teaching seminars and providing consultations to fellow graduate students on teaching strategies and research.
