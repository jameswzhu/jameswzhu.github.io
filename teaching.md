I have always loved being a teacher and mentor to younger students. I have 4 semesters of Teaching Assistant experience between Vanderbilt and CMU in the following classes:

* Dyanmics: Spring 2022 and Spring 2023
* Intro to Robotics: Spring 2019
* Probability and Statistical Inference: Spring 2019

In addition, I have also worked as a Teaching Consultant Fellow for the
[CMU Eberly Center](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/index.html), collaborating in teaching seminars and providing consultations to fellow graduate students on pedagogical strategies and research.
