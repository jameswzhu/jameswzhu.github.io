**This was the product of my internship at the RAI Institute during Spring 2024. Full paper is in preparation.**

As robots become more common in public spaces, autonomous delivery robots (ADRs) are already operating in many cities. While ADR companies highlight their convenience and sustainability, access to these technologies has been limited, especially for underserved populations. This paper focuses on food pantry patrons, a group that could benefit from ADRs but has been underrepresented in user research. Through interviews with 21 food pantry patrons in Boston, the study identifies specific needs that ADRs could address and finds a general openness to using ADR services. The findings suggest that ADR technology development should be guided by the needs of such communities, encouraging collaboration between the robotics industry and government organizations to better serve underrepresented populations.
