As of September 6th, 2024 I have officially passed my PhD thesis defense! I also received my MS in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon in 2022 and BE in Mechanical Engineering and Math from Vanderbilt University in 2020.
During my PhD, I worked with Dr. Aaron Johnson in the [Robomechanics Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/me/robomechanicslab/) at Carnegie Mellon University. 

My goal is to ensure that robots contribute positively and equitably to society. To achieve this, I approach robots as socio-technical systems, recognizing the importance of integrating technical, social, and policy dimensions for successful deployments. My PhD research has advanced the reliability and robustness of legged robot locomotion while also addressing policy considerations and social science perspectives to promote equity and broaden access to robotic technologies.

I am currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities at the intersection of robotics and society.

Here is my research output that I have worked on:
