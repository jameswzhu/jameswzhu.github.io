I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/en/teams/ris/) in Toulouse, France. I received my MS and PhD from Carnegie Mellon in 2022 and 2024, respectively, and BE from Vanderbilt University in 2020.
During my PhD, I worked with Dr. Aaron Johnson in the [Robomechanics Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/me/robomechanicslab/) at Carnegie Mellon University. 

My goal is to ensure that robots contribute positively and equitably to society. To achieve this, I approach robots as socio-technical systems, recognizing the importance of integrating technical, social, and policy dimensions for successful deployments. My PhD research has advanced the reliability and robustness of legged robot locomotion while also addressing policy considerations and social science perspectives to promote equity and broaden access to robotic technologies.

Here is my research output that I have worked on:
