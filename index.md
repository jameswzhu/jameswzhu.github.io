I am a PhD student studying Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

I work with Dr. Aaron Johnson in the [Robomechanics Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/me/robomechanicslab/), where my two main reserach thrusts are the control of legged robots in complex environments and the implications for when these robots are deployed in public human environments.

I received my MS in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon in 2022 and BE in Mechanical Engineering and Math from Vanderbilt University in 2020.

Here is my research output that I have worked on:
