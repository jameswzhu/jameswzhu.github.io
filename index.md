As of September 6th, 2024 I have officially passed my PhD thesis defense! I also received my MS in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon in 2022 and BE in Mechanical Engineering and Math from Vanderbilt University in 2020.
During my PhD, I worked with Dr. Aaron Johnson in the [Robomechanics Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/me/robomechanicslab/) at Carnegie Mellon University. 

My objective is to enable robots to have positive and equitable impacts on people's lives. To accomplish this, I view robots as socio-technical systems that require a deep understanding of the technical, social, and policy aspects of robot deployments in order to be successful. During my PhD research, I have contributed work that has improved the reliability and robustness of legged robot locomotion as well as policy considerations and social science work to foster equity and expand access to robot technologies.

I am actively seeking postdoctoral positions at the intersection of robotics and society.

Here is my research output that I have worked on:
